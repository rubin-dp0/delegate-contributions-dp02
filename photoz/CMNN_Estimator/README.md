# CMNN Estimator

This directory is for code and notebooks that apply a lightweight version of the [CMNN Estimator](https://github.com/dirac-institute/CMNN_Photoz_Estimator) to galaxies in the DP0.2 Object catalog.

All are welcome to contribute notebooks to this directory.

Just add a line to the table below for every file added.

| File | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|
| leave-one-out_method.ipynb | An extremely simplistic demo that uses a single set of galaxies as both test and training set. This notebook is only useful for estimating rudimentary photo-z for a small number of galaxies. It has a "Future Work" section to describe the next steps. | Melissa Graham |


# note

These notebooks will not work with the DP0.1 data set.
