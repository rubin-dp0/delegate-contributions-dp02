This directory is for notebooks that combine DP0.2 with Roman simulated data.

All are welcome to contribute to this directory.

Add a line to the table below for every file or sub-directory added.

Ensure sub-directories also have a README.md file like this one.

| Name | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|
| 1_match_DP0_Troxel.ipynb | Cross-match DP0 Objects to the Roman simulation of Troxel et al. (2023). | Melissa Graham |
| 2_fit_star_SED_optIR.ipynb | Demonstrate fitting LSST star magnitudes as blackbodies, with and without the infrared Roman filters. | Melissa Graham |
| 3_images_tutorial_DP0+Roman.ipynb | Detect and visualize sources in Roman and Rubin simulated images over an overlapping region. | Chien-Hao Lin, Melissa Graham |
| 3b_images_tutorial_DP0+Roman_firefly_alternate_detection.ipynb | Similar to 3_images_tutorial_DP0+Roman.ipynb, except it uses Firefly for image display and incorporates steps from the DP0.2 "NB05 Source Detection and Measurement" tutorial for image processing of the Roman simulations. | Chien-Hao Lin, Melissa Graham, Andrés A.
