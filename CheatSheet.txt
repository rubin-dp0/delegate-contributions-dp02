# This is a cheat sheet of GitHub commands for DP0 delegates using this repository.
# This cheat sheet was initially prepared by Doug Tucker for the Stack Cub members.  
# The following will be most useful to people who are new to git and command lines.

# Below, "your_name" = your GitHub username.
# "This repository" is "delegate-contributions-dp02".
# "This GitHub Org" is "rubin-dp0".

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Get started - make a local copy of this repo in your home directory.
# In the Notebook Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform (JupyterLab), launch a terminal.

# First, check your present working directory:
pwd

# This should return /home/your_name

# Now list the contents of your present working directory:
ls

# You will see that you have a notebooks directory. Go into it:
cd notebooks

# You will see that two directories already exist: system_test and tutorial-notebooks
# The tutorial-notebooks directory will match the repository with the same name in this GitHub Org.

# Clone this repository, delegate-contributions-dp02, into your notebooks directory:
git clone https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp02.git

# Now go into it:
cd delegate-contributions-dp02

# List the contents:
ls

# This list will match what you see in https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp02
# Including this CheatSheet.txt file.

# Here are some useful "git" commands:
git status       # returns current branch, changed files; use this frequently
git branch -a    # list all branches of this repo
git remote -v    # list the remotes for this repo

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Prepare to work - make yourself a branch and switch to it

# By default, right after a "git clone", you will be in the "main" branch.

# Create a new branch to use for your own work, and switch to that branch in one command.
# By convention, we name user branches "u/your_name":
git checkout -b u/your_name

# Confirm that you are working in your new branch
git branch
git status

# Alternatively, you could create a new branch *without* switching to it:
git branch u/your_name

# To switch to any existing branch at any time:
git checkout u/your_name

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Work in your branch - edit files and notebooks or create new ones
 
# If editing/creating a notebook:
#  1. make your changes until you are 'done'
#  2. from menu bar select Kernel --> Restart and Run All Cells
#  3. fix errors until the whole notebook executes
#  4. from menu bar select Kernel --> Restart and Clear All Cells
#  5. from menu bar select File --> Save Notebook 

# The final save should be a cleared notebook with no executed cells.

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Commit changes to your local branch
# This can be done periodically as you work

# Check which files have been changed
git status

# All of the changed files must be added in order to commit
# Add files one at a time
git add <filename>

# Check that all changed files have been added
git status

# Commit your changes to the local branch
git commit -m "Leave a short comment within quotes"

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Push your commits to your branch of the remote repository
# This can be done periodically, or only when you're "finished"

git push origin u/your_name

# You might be asked for your password at this point.
# You can avoid having to do this all the time by setting up your git credentials.
# See the bottom part of the README.md file for this GitHub Org for instructions.

# After this, your changes will appear in your branch at https://github.com/rubin-dp0.

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Pull Requests -- merge your branch into main to share your work with everyone

# Start here: https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp02/pulls
# Click on green "New pull request" button.
# Choose "main" and then "u/your_name".
# The arrow should point FROM "u/your-name" TO "main".

# If the branch is able to be merged to main, you be able to select "Create pull request".
# Name your pull request (your PR) and leave a few comments describing the changes in your branch.
# Your PR will be given a number.

# On your PR's page, at the top of the left-hand side bar, click on "Reviewers".
# Assign another delegate to review your proposed changes to "main".
# It is convention that all shared code should be reviewed.
# Address any comments or concerns that your reviewer has with additional commits to your branch.

# So long as you see a green checkmark and your code is reviewed, you're OK to merge.
# It's preferable to choose "rebase and merge", but "merge pull request" is ok too.

# Immediately after merging, you will see:
#  "Pull request successfully merged and closed"
# And you are offered an opportunity to delete the branch.
# If you anticipate using your branch again in the near future, keep it.
# Otherwise, delete the branch.

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Alternative commands for merging and deleting branches

# First, delete the local version of branch u/your_name
git branch -d u/your_name

# Then push that deletion to the remote verison of the branch
git push origin --delete u/your_name

# You can do much of the above using this step-by-step command-line version:
git checkout main                     # Switch from u/your_name back to master branch (locally)
git pull origin main                  # Make sure local master branch is up-to-date with remote origin master branch on github
git branch --merged                   # Check to see if u/your_name has been merged locally
git merge u/your_name                 # Merge u/your_name with local master branch
git branch --merged                   # Verify the merge worked
git push origin main                  # Push local master back to remote origin master on github
git branch -d u/your_name             # Delete local version of u/your_name
git push origin --delete u/your_name  # Delete remote version of u/your_name on github
git branch -a                         # Verify that the local and remote versions of u/your_name have been deleted

-----------------------------------------------------------
Other useful git commands:

git --version
# Two commands below might be necessary to execute the command "git push origin u/your_name" (you would have seen an error message) 
git config --global user.email "your_name@yourinstitution.com"  # create/update your e-mail address in the local git configuration
git config --global user.name "your_name"   # create/update your username in the local git configuration
git config --list
git config --help
git help config
git log
git diff
